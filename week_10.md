## Touch sensor double tap 
The poster submission is coming up very close hence this idea is postponed till later on. 

However, due to the poor conductive nature of the pin due to superglue on it, it was essentially requiring a multiple hard tap for it to register the touch.


## Multi sensors 
This will be investigated further.
