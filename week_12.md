## Project Completion

Parth put together the final model and it looks pretty good.

However on the day of the presentation we had some issues (super glue came off) and everything was held together by bluetac but it all worked.
The app connected seamlessly with the model and the pi could be safely put into the model.

Overall evaluation will be in the final paper.

The whole process taught me a lot about working in terms towards a goal and we communicated well to achieve it. 

I also appreciate the contributions of our supervisor Dr Matthew Butler, who helped and guided us throughout the process.
