# 3D Printing and Low Cost Electronics

## Introduction
Vision impaired people have a different perception of the world. We met up with Matthew Butler, who will be supervising our work throughout the semester. 

Matthew introduced us to several things we take for granted that vision imparied people struggle with in various aspects of daily lives.

#### Education
Many students have trouble understanding visual content in the lectures. The current process is to send off the visuals to be meta-tagged so that students with vision impaired can be able to engage with it. However, the process is time consuming and very subjective; the meta tags accuracy and detail depends on the mercy of the reviewer. 

There is a push for accessible education environment, hence there is a lot of scope for the project. 

#### Orientation and Mobility (Transport)
Getting around a city independently is one of the most important thing that a vision imparied person wants to do. Public transport places like train stations can be really confusing to navigate. Hence, there is lots of demand for 3D Models that can improve orientation and mobility in the scope of public transport. There are several methods that can be used to create 3D informative maps. 3D printing or 3D tactile maps.

There is scope to investigate and improve O&M, by constructing better 3D Maps and possibly integrating low cost electronics to enhance interactivity.
