## Introduction
Vision impaired people have a different perception of the world. We met up with Matthew Butler, who will be supervising our work throughout the semester. 

Matthew introduced us to several things we take for granted that vision imparied people struggle with.

There are many problems in the vision impaired space.

#### Education
Many students have trouble understanding visual content in the lectures.

There is a push for accessible education environment, hence there is a lot of scope for the project.
