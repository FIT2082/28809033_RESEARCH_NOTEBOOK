## Brainstorm Ideas
We were interested in a few topics after the initial meeting. There is so much scope for research. One particular thing that caught our attention was the idea of 'smart' 3D maps. 

However a few other ideas discussed were using AI to meta tag educational content and also improve the ways questions are presented to vision impared students in an exam, creating an inclusive environment. 

## SensiLab Visit
This week we also visited the SensiLab facility and got a tour of the place. The place is mainly built for the interaction of arts and computing. The project will utilize facilities and resource at Sensilab, such as 3D printing, soldering and electronics available. 

## Knowledge Review

![alt text](https://fit2082.github.io/28809033_RESEARCH_NOTEBOOK/images/Capture.PNG "Accessible 3D Maps - Matthew Butler")

There is a paper "Accessible Maps for the Blind" by Matthew Butler et al. that focusses on the development of 3D models and comparing them with tactile printed maps. There exists interactive 3D models which can be touched and play audio files based on the touch. It is fairly limited and we aim to extend the functionality to allow connection with smartphones.

Other than the touch sensor based 3D models, there are not many alternatives available.

## Reflection
SensiLab at Caulfield seems like a very nice facility and am very excited to be working on the project. After going away and spending some time thinking, we seem to have a decent project going on. We have narrowed down the scope and are happy with a certain topic which will integrate together as a final product based on expertise of the team. 

We have a research project specifications deadline next week, hence we aim to get a draft out and validate our ideas and ensure they align with Matthew's expectations.
