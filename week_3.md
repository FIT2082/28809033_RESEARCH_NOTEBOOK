## Brainstorm Ideas
We were interested in a few topics after the initial meeting. There is so much scope for research. One particular thing that caught our attention was the idea of 'smart' 3D maps. 

However a few other ideas discussed were using AI to meta tag educational content and also improve the ways questions are presented to vision impared students in an exam, creating an inclusive environment. 

## SensiLab Visit
This week we also visited the SensiLab facility and got a tour of the place. The place is mainly built for the interaction of arts and computing. The project will utilize facilities and resource at Sensilab, such as 3D printing, soldering and electronics available.
