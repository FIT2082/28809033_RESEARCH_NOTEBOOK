# Week 5

## Raspberry PI Setup
Raspberry PI Model 3 is a very intersting device for a few reasons. The device features inbuilt Bluetooth and Wi-Fi modules. The PI has Bluetooth Low Energy capability that can be used in the project. 

The indended usage of the PI is as follows: 
* BLE: to act as a beacon and transmit values for the phone to recieve in real time (almost) 
* Wireless: to connect to internet to fetch and update software and use as fallback option if Bluetooth fails
* IO Pins: to communicate with a capacitive touch sensor to map touch points on the 3D model
